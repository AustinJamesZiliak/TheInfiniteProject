Tonight I set up the project and started the student class which holds grades. This projects purpose is to take grades, missing assignment and recent low scoring assignments(hopfuly scraped from Infinite Campus) and apply them to an algarithm to deturmen where students need to go for soar. Eventually we need to implement a tempary file IO system so we can do tests on a large bulk of students.
