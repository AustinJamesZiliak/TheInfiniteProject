Tonight I set up the project and started the student class which holds grades. The purpose of This project is to take grades, missing assignments, and recent low-scoring assignments(hopefully scraped from Infinite Campus) and apply them to an algorithm to determine where students need to go for soar. Eventually, we need to implement a temporary file IO system so we can do tests on a large bulk of students.
